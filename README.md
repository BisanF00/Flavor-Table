# Flavor-Table 2

## Overview :

### This assignment upgrades the Flavor Table app to use a PostgreSQL database instead of localStorage for recipe management. The main goal is to refactor the existing "Flavor Table" application to use a PostgreSQL database instead of localStorage for recipe storage and management, implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## * How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?

### It took me a total of 16 hours over four days.

## * Were there any parts of the lab you found challenging?

### I think actually in using CRUD in the code at all.
